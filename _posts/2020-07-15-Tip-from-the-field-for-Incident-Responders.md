title: Detective Notes 

---

Working in infosec field requires the person to be highly organized espcially when responding to a cyber incident in a complex environment. The amount of data to collected for later reference is overwhelming Proper note taking is the key, and will help you later during incident briefing and reporting. 


<!-- more -->

Structured template or notes to fill during the analysis is very useful. Each indicator or abnormal activity you encounter should be written down. Spreadsheet is a good option to document incident findings (mostly IOCs) and how did you finding them.

Maybe you could create the following pages:

* **Assets Involved** → ID, Hostname, IP Address, Type, Network segment 

* **Host Based** → DateTime, Asset ID, Type, Value 

* **Network Based** → DateTime, Asset ID, Type, Value 

* **Techniques** → DateTime, MITRE Technique/Description, Asset ID

* **Tools** 

You could have another page for rough writing like a diary for the incident itself and how it was investigated and recovered.
