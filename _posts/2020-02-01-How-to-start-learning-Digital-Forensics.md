title: How to start learning Digital Forensics

---

If you are planning to start your journey in the field of digital forensics but you don’t have good materials to start, I will suggest you some books to start reading with the assumptions that you have all the basic IT fundamentals. You can read them one after another along with your regular subjects if you are still in college.

The order of these books matters. I tried to start with the basic ones to the more advanced.

This is one of my favorite books, it will introduce you to the process of evidence acquisition. Evidence acquisition is crucial, If not done properly then you can’t carry on with the later phases of the investigation. The book discussed only free and open source tools. On top of everything it’s from the beloved publishing company, No Starch Press.

You got ton of books to read and learn. After reading and grasping the content of all these book, you will not find more books to read because they will repeat same introduction and many topics you will already know .You should develop the habit to read research and conference papers.

Finally, I am not a big fan of online video courses. I love books but still you can take online training. We can’t just leave this list without pointing out to SANS courses. If you can afford SANS training then go ahead with it.
