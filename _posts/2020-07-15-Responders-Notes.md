title: Responders Notes 

---

Working in infosec field requires the person to be highly organized espcially when responding to a cyber incident in a complex environment. The amount of data to collected is overwhelming. Proper note taking is the key, and will help you later during incident briefing and reporting.

Structured template to fill during the analysis is very useful. For each indicator or abnormal activity you encounter should be written down. I believe  spreadsheet is a good option to document incident findings (mostly IOCs) and how did you finding them.

Maybe you could create the following sheets:

* **Assets Involved** → ID, Hostname, IP Address, Type, Network segment 

* **Host Based** → DateTime, Asset ID, Type, Value 

* **Network Based** → DateTime, Asset ID, Type, Value 

* **Techniques** → DateTime, MITRE Technique/Description, Asset ID

* **Tools** 

You could have another page for rough writing like a diary for the incident itself and how it was investigated and recovered.
